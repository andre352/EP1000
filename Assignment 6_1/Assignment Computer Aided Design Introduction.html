				<br><br><br><br>

				<h2><u>Step 5</u></h2>
				<p>Next is to find the centre point of the middle line and then use "Draw rectangle using centre point" with a height of 10mm and length of 60mm. Then use "edge to edge circle" to draw at the sides of the rectangle.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>when you are at the centre point of the middle line, a triangle will be shown</li>
					<li>trim away the parts you do not need</li>
					<li>after doing all the steps above, click on finish sketch</li>
